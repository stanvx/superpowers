## Problem & Goal

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow plugin for coding agents, built around composable skills. The existing plugin targets Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Gemini CLI. This fork — `superpowers-copilot` — creates a distributable Copilot CLI plugin that brings all 15 skills to Copilot CLI users, with `/fleet`-native parallel agent dispatch and request-efficient conversational patterns as first-class concerns.

---

## Approach: Layered Fork (Approach C)

A thin adaptation layer covers the 12 simpler skills via a single tool-mapping reference file. The three highest-leverage skills (`dispatching-parallel-agents`, `subagent-driven-development`, `using-superpowers`) get deeper Copilot CLI-native rewrites. A new cross-skill reference (`copilot-workflow.md`) documents `/fleet` patterns, `/research` integration, and request-efficiency principles.

## Architecture

**Total scope:** 3 new files, 7 modified files.

## Components

### 1. `plugin.json` (NEW)

Copilot CLI plugin manifest at the repository root.

```json
{
  "name": "superpowers-copilot",
  "description": "Complete dev workflow for Copilot CLI: TDD, /fleet-native parallel agents, subagent handoffs, debugging, and more",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "Trent Stanton" },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/trentstanton/superpowers-copilot",
  "license": "MIT",
  "keywords": ["skills", "tdd", "fleet", "subagents", "debugging", "workflows"]
}
```

### 2. `AGENTS.md` (NEW)

Auto-loaded by Copilot CLI at session start. Single instruction:

> This repo uses the superpowers-copilot plugin. Immediately invoke the `using-superpowers` skill before any response or action.

Safety net for programmatic invocations where the session-start hook may not fire.

### 3. `skills/using-superpowers/references/copilot-cli-tools.md` (NEW)

Tool name mapping table. Loaded by `using-superpowers` so all other skills implicitly benefit.

| Skill references | Copilot CLI tool |
|---|---|
| `Skill` | `skill` (same) |
| `Task` (subagent dispatch) | `task` (same) |
| `Read` / `view` | `view` (same) |
| `Write` / `create` | `create` (same) |
| `Edit` | `edit` (same) |
| `Bash` | `bash` (same) |
| `Grep` | `grep` (same) |
| `Glob` | `glob` (same) |
| `TodoWrite` | `sql` (session database) |
| `WebSearch` | `web_search` |
| `WebFetch` | `web_fetch` |

Note: Copilot CLI tool names are nearly identical to Claude Code. The three name divergences are `TodoWrite` → `sql` (session DB), `WebSearch` → `web_search`, and `WebFetch` → `web_fetch`. The first only affects process skills; the latter two affect skills that do research or fetch URLs.

### 4. `skills/using-superpowers/references/copilot-workflow.md` (NEW)

Cross-skill reference covering three topics any skill can cite:

**Request efficiency** — Copilot CLI bills per user message (not per token). Skills should guide the agent to ask all clarifying questions up front, batch context generously into subagent `task` calls, and use `/compact` only when approaching context limits rather than proactively.

**`/research` integration** — When `brainstorming` is invoked, an optional pre-flight offer: *"Would a `/research` report on this topic help before we design?"* If accepted, the agent fires `/research TOPIC` and references the report when forming clarifying questions. Opt-in only, not automatic.

**`/fleet` quick-reference** — Condensed parallel dispatch pattern for skills that need to mention fleet without loading the full `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill.

### 5. `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` (MODIFIED)

Adds a **"In Copilot CLI"** section:

- Access skills via the `skill` tool
- Load `copilot-cli-tools.md` for the tool name mapping
- Load `copilot-workflow.md` for `/fleet`, `/research`, and request-efficiency guidance
- Remainder of file unchanged

### 6. `skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md` (MODIFIED — deep rewrite)

The current skill teaches a `Task()` dispatch pattern suited for Claude Code. This is rewritten around `/fleet` as the native primitive.

**Pattern 1 — Direct `/fleet` dispatch** (2–4 independent tasks):
```
/fleet Fix the 3 test failures — Agent 1: fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts (timing issues). Agent 2: fix batch-completion.test.ts (event structure). Agent 3: fix race-conditions.test.ts (async wait).
```
Each fleet agent gets its own context window, works in parallel, returns a summary. The main agent reviews and integrates.

**Pattern 2 — Staged fleet with handoff** (tasks with a dependency seam):
```
Stage 1: /fleet [research + plan tasks in parallel]
Stage 2: /fleet [implementation tasks, using Stage 1 outputs]
```

The decision flowchart structure is preserved from the original; leaf nodes name `/fleet` explicitly instead of `Task()`.

**When NOT to use `/fleet`:**
- Tasks write to the same files (agents would conflict)
- You need to see one result before knowing the next task
- Fewer than 2 independent domains (sequential is simpler)

### 7. `skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` (MODIFIED)

The three-stage review loop (implementer → spec-reviewer → code-quality-reviewer) maps directly onto Copilot CLI's `task` tool. Logic is unchanged; mechanics are updated.

**Handoff state machine:**
```
Main agent
  └─ task(implementer-prompt.md + task spec + relevant file context)
       └─ Implementer implements, tests, commits, self-reviews
  └─ task(spec-reviewer-prompt.md + spec + diff)
       └─ Returns: APPROVED or issues list
  [if issues] └─ task(implementer, fix-list) → re-run spec-reviewer
  └─ task(code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md + diff)
       └─ Returns: APPROVED or issues list (final gate — not re-looped; surface to human if blocked)
  └─ Mark complete in sql todos table
```

**Copilot CLI adaptations:**
- All three subagent prompt files updated with Copilot CLI tool names
- `TodoWrite` → `sql` in all prompts
- SKILL.md gains a request-efficiency note: each `task` call is one request — pass context generously rather than having the subagent call back for clarifications

### 8. Subagent prompt files (MODIFIED)

`implementer-prompt.md`, `spec-reviewer-prompt.md`, `code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`: update tool references (`TodoWrite` → `sql`, confirm other tool names match `copilot-cli-tools.md`).

### 9. `hooks/hooks.json` (MODIFIED)

The `SessionStart` event name is shared with Claude Code. The `matcher` field filters which session events trigger the hook — `"startup|resume|clear|compact"` fires on new sessions, resumes, and manual context resets, matching the same moments in Claude Code.

The path variable must be confirmed against the actual Copilot CLI hook execution environment during implementation. Claude Code exposes `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; the Copilot CLI equivalent is likely `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` but **must be verified** against the [Copilot CLI hooks documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-hooks) before committing. If Copilot CLI does not expose a plugin root variable, the fallback is an absolute path resolved at install time, or relying solely on `AGENTS.md` for session-start behavior.

`hooks/run-hook.cmd` is **in scope** for a one-line path variable update (same change as `hooks.json`). No other changes to that file.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume|clear|compact",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"${COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/run-hook.cmd\" session-start",
            "async": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 10. `README.md` (MODIFIED)

Add Copilot CLI installation section. The plugin marketplace registration is a post-implementation step. Until a marketplace is established, direct GitHub installation is used:

```
### GitHub Copilot CLI

# Direct install from GitHub (before marketplace listing)
/plugin install https://github.com/trentstanton/superpowers-copilot

# Once listed on a marketplace:
/plugin install superpowers-copilot@<marketplace-name>
```

Plus a brief description of the Copilot CLI-specific features (`/fleet` integration, request-efficient design).

---

## Data Flow

```
Session start
  → AGENTS.md loaded → agent invokes using-superpowers skill
  → using-superpowers loads copilot-cli-tools.md + copilot-workflow.md
  → Agent knows all tool mappings and Copilot CLI patterns

User asks to build something
  → brainstorming skill invoked
  → optional: /research pre-flight
  → clarifying questions (request-efficient: batch up front)
  → design presented and approved
  → writing-plans skill

User says "go"
  → subagent-driven-development skill
  → task(implementer) → task(spec-reviewer) → task(quality-reviewer) → done
  → if independent tasks: dispatching-parallel-agents → /fleet
```

---

## Out of Scope

- Changes to the 12 skills not named above
- New skills (this is a port, not a feature addition)
- Copilot CLI marketplace listing setup (post-implementation step; direct GitHub install used in interim)
- Windows `run-hook.cmd` changes beyond the one-line path variable update (see Component 9)

---

## Success Criteria

1. `plugin.json` valid and installable via `/plugin install`
2. All 15 skills accessible via `skill` tool in a Copilot CLI session
3. `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill explicitly guides the agent to use `/fleet`
4. `subagent-driven-development` handoff loop works end-to-end with Copilot CLI `task` tool
5a. Session-start hook mechanism is wired correctly in `hooks.json` and `run-hook.cmd`
5b. Hook fires and invokes `using-superpowers` correctly — contingent on `COPILOT_PLUGIN_ROOT` being confirmed; if the env var is unavailable, `AGENTS.md` serves as the verified fallback
6. `AGENTS.md` triggers `using-superpowers` in programmatic sessions
